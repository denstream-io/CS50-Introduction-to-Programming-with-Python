HarvardX CS50 [CS50P] Lectures Problem Sets 2022 

I wrote these codes to learn from you, just as you have learnt from it, the codes were written as the specifications defined them - I didn't bother to add, like, extra functions. I'm always open to learning efficient ways to implement the problem sets, if you have read any part of the code and felt there's a better way to implement it, please feel free to give your valuable suggestions :partying_face:

Don't forget Harvard's [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/honesty/#:~:text=This%20course%E2%80%99s%20philosophy%20on%20academic%20honesty%20is%20best,of%20another%20and%20submitting%20the%20work%20of%20another.).
